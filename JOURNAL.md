## 10/10/2025 - Reasearch and basic concept made. Parts planned out.   

![Screenshot 2025-10-10 202001.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0c7749ea35955f57ea7d3ae6c54a21cdcef9f91d/Screenshot%202025-10-10%20202001.png)


Finally finished the first part of the research and planning. I've settled on building this thing around a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W....kinda like that other fidelity project i was planning on.

### **THE MASTER PLAN** 

**CORE**
It's all based around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W which will handle all the processing for both gaming and music. The entire power system is built around it, with USB-C for easy charging.

**UI**
Itâ€™s got a bright, landscape color TFT screen for all the visuals. For controls, there's a full set of gaming buttons: a D-Pad, A/B/X/Y, plus Start and Select. To make it feel premium, im adding HAPTIC!

**MEDIA AND STORAGE**
A high-quality I2S digital audio system will drive both a built-in speaker and a headphone jack (maybe bluetooth too). All the games and music will be loaded from a microSD card slot.
  

## 10/11/2025 - Updates  

Made new updates:

We are going to add triggers on the back of the console, right on top of where the battery will be placed as you can see in the crude diagram I have attached above. We will also be adding features to spport using a dock in the future, kinda like the nintendo switch. 

Also finalised base hardware and bom.  

## 10/12/2025 - Mockup and basic battery and circuit protection circuit made  

### Mockup and Battery Protection

Finished a basic mockup which ill be basing the project on. I've made my battery protection circuit using DW01A and FS8205A boards.

I used blender to make a quick mockup of how i want the project to look...

The DW01A is a battery protection IC and the FS8205A acts as an efficient switch to protect against overcurrent by switching power paths.

## 10/17/2025 - Fixed errors and routed pcb  

I just realised the circuit in the other photo wasnt completely refined so i went ahead and fixed it. I finished routing the PCB.

This PCB will serve as the main battery protection circuit, which I have decided to leave as seperate module. Next step of the process will be making the I2S DAC circuit.
