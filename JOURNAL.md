Finally finished the first part of the research and planning. I've settled on building this thing around a Raspberry Pi Pico W....kinda like thatother fidelity project i was planning on.

### **THE MASTER PLAN** 

**CORE**
It's all based around the Raspberry Pi Pico W which will handle all the processing for both gaming and music. The entire power system is built around it, with USB-C for easy charging.

**UI**
Itâ€™s got a bright, landscape color TFT screen for all the visuals. For controls, there's a full set of gaming buttons: a D-Pad, A/B/X/Y, plus Start and Select. To make it feel premium, im adding HAPTIC!

**MEDIA AND STORAGE**
A high-quality I2S digital audio system will drive both a built-in speaker and a headphone jack (maybe bluetooth too). All the games and music will be loaded from a microSD card slot.
