## 10/10/2025 - Reasearch and basic concept made. Parts planned out.   

![Screenshot 2025-10-10 202001.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0c7749ea35955f57ea7d3ae6c54a21cdcef9f91d/Screenshot%202025-10-10%20202001.png)


Finally finished the first part of the research and planning. I've settled on building this thing around a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W....kinda like that other fidelity project i was planning on.

### **THE MASTER PLAN** 

**CORE**
It's all based around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W which will handle all the processing for both gaming and music. The entire power system is built around it, with USB-C for easy charging.

**UI**
Itâ€™s got a bright, landscape color TFT screen for all the visuals. For controls, there's a full set of gaming buttons: a D-Pad, A/B/X/Y, plus Start and Select. To make it feel premium, im adding HAPTIC!

**MEDIA AND STORAGE**
A high-quality I2S digital audio system will drive both a built-in speaker and a headphone jack (maybe bluetooth too). All the games and music will be loaded from a microSD card slot.
  

## 10/11/2025 - Updates  

Made new updates:

We are going to add triggers on the back of the console, right on top of where the battery will be placed as you can see in the crude diagram I have attached above. We will also be adding features to spport using a dock in the future, kinda like the nintendo switch. 

Also finalised base hardware and bom.  

## 10/12/2025 - Mockup and basic battery and circuit protection circuit made  

### Mockup and Battery Protection

Finished a basic mockup which ill be basing the project on. I've made my battery protection circuit using DW01A and FS8205A boards.

I used blender to make a quick mockup of how i want the project to look...

The DW01A is a battery protection IC and the FS8205A acts as an efficient switch to protect against overcurrent by switching power paths.

## 10/17/2025 - Fixed errors and routed pcb  

I just realised the circuit in the other photo wasnt completely refined so i went ahead and fixed it. I finished routing the PCB.

This PCB will serve as the main battery protection circuit, which I have decided to leave as seperate module. Next step of the process will be making the I2S DAC circuit.
   

## 10/19/2025 - Completed 5V boost controller schematic  

I completed the schematic for the voltage boost controller circuit. It uses the MT3608, which is a small frequency step up converter.

I started with the MT3608 and built the circuit using thestandard parts for the circuit. Ive also added a trimmer potentiometer so that I can set the output voltage to any value up to 28 V for further applications.

Most of the time spent on the project is research into how ill be making the circuit.

Ive also completed base research into how ill be making the next part, the I2S DAC circuit.
  

## 10/20/2025 - Made some changes and routed PCB  

I found a fatal design flaw, where if Icranked up the resistor to 100k ohm it would fry the MT3608. Fixed it, also changed the design to use polarized tantalum capacitors which have a low ESR, unlike normal electrolytic capacitors.

Here is the schematic: ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzcwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ac5e396a5d18671cd47c1b22fced18a5b1a064e4/image.png)


I also finished routing the pcb, which took around 30 mins as it was rather simple wih only a few components. What took up most of the time was doing research for the required trace thickness I would require for the best possible results.

Here is the routing:![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzcwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--782a4e5418eb9aedaea3a475bedaf20fd9d55f8e/image.png)

## 10/24/2025 - Combined both PCBs for an integrated circuit. Routed PCB  

Decided to switch to a PCB that has both the boost IC and power protection circuit to save costs on PCB manufacturing. Added net ports and finished routing. Came across a problem due to trace widths which I fixed using 0.6 as the min track width. I also positioned the pins strategically for the entire project. Also added gnd pours. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTE0NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e1553524465f3c02ade97b6634c93f7aa9bc5f7a/image.png)
